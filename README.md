# README

This Blog was built using rails 5.0.0rc1. For this build the tutorial I followed didn't use devise for authentication
the author created his own User model and controller, which I found a valuable process as it gave me an appreciation for
how easy devise does make it!

##Installation
- git clone
- bundle
- rails db:migrate
